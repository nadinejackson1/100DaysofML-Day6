# 100 Days of Machine Learning: Day 6

# Gradient Descent and Linear Regression

### Overview

This repository contains an implementation of gradient descent for linear regression using Python. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how gradient descent can be used to optimize a simple linear regression model.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and run the gradient_descent_linear_regression.py file in your Python environment.

    git clone https://github.com/nadinejackson1/100DaysofML-Day6.git
    cd 100DaysofML-Day6
    python 100DaysofML-Day6.py

### Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

    NumPy

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

    pip install numpy

### Usage

The 100DaysofML-Day6.py file contains the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm for a simple linear regression problem. You can modify the code to experiment with different datasets or tweak the parameters of the algorithm.
